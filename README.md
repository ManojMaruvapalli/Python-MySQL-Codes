 9.7 Linear List Implimentation. A charity organization conducts camps in various locations of a city. Each camp is located at a location at a sepcific date. The organization maintains a montl1ly list of camp planned in this format:
	03 New Cly, 18 T Nagar, 25 K Pura.
		Where first two digits of every entry signify the date on which the camp is to be conducted. Write a program to inplement this along with the following point:
			(i) A linear list, planned, stores the camps that are to be conducted. A camp's detils are added to planned list once NOC is obtained.
			(ii) As soon as a camp is conducted, its details are moved to list conducted and removed from planned list.
			(iii) Each camp servers some people.
			(iv) The program should be able to provide options for adding to planned list, getting conducted camp's details, searching for a camp, a report of how many camps we are conducted so far and how many people were served and display the linear lists planned and conducted.
